Challenge #3
We have a nested object, we would like a function that you pass in the object and a key and get
back the value. How this is implemented is up to you.

I used python as it had dictionary concept with which we can easily handle nested objects like key,value pairs.dicttionary get() methods will return the value of item with specific key.
